## 导出仓库

通常我们会有将整个Git仓库文件导出的需求，可以使用如下代码：

    //使用git archive命令
    //从master分支打包文件到指定的目录，格式为zip。如果不指定output，那么则向
    //标准输出输出内容
    git archive --format zip --output /full/path/to/zipfile.zip master

    //使用git checkout-index命令，注意--prefix参数最后的/，如果不指定的话，那么则会把导出的文件全部加上改prefix前缀，比如：/destination/path.code.c
    git checkout-index -a -f --prefix=/destination/path/



QUOTE [^1]

> I found out what option 2 means. From a repository, you can do:

> git checkout-index -a -f --prefix=/destination/path/

> The slash at the end of the path is important, otherwise it will result in the files being in /destination with a prefix of 'path'.

> Since in a normal situation the index contains the contents of the repository, there is nothing special to do to "read the desired tree into the index". It's already there.

> The -a flag is required to check out all files in the index (I'm not sure what it means to omit this flag in this situation, since it doesn't do what I want). The -f flag forces overwriting any existing files in the output, which this command doesn't normally do.

> This appears to be the sort of "git export" I was looking for.

QUOTE [^2]

> git export ~/the/destination/dir

> If the destination directory already exists, you'll need to add -f or --force.

> Installation is simple; just drop the script somewhere in your PATH, and make sure it's executable.

## Patch

通常使用diff 和 patch 可以对文件获取补丁，然后打补丁。 如果你使用Git的话，那么可以使用`git diff` 和 `git format-patch` 来创建patch。 然后使用`git apply` 和 `git am` 来应用patch。

关于`git-diff` 以及 `git format-patch` 的区别如下：

QUOTE [^3]

> A patch created with git format-patch will also include some meta-information about the commit (committer, date, commit message, ...) and will contains diff of binary data. Everything will be formatted as a mail, so that it can be easily sent. The person that receive it can then recreate the corresponding commit with git am and all meta-data will be intact. It can also be applied with git apply as it is a super-set of a simple diff.

> A patch crated with git diff will be a simple diff with context (think diff -u). It can also be applied with git apply but the meta-data will not be recreated (as they are not present).

> In summary, git format-patch is useful to transmit a commit, while git diff is useful to get a diff between two trees.

QUOTE [^4]

Patch formats


Each patch file comes in , called normal, context and unified diff. You can identify them by looking at the contents of the patch file.

Normal diffs have a lot of lines that start with > or <:

    ...
    51
    < background-color: red;
    ---
    > background-color: blue;
    ...


Context diffs have a lot of lines with stars ***** in them and lines starting with !, + and -:

    ...
    ***************
    *** 44,54 ****

      html, body { color: #242626; }
      html {
    !   background-color: red;
        height: 100%;
        margin-bottom:;
        overflow-y: scroll;
    --- 44,54 ----

      html, body { color: #242626; }

    !   background-color: blue;
        height: 100%;
        margin-bottom:;
        overflow-y: scroll;
    ...


And finally unified diffs have a lot of lines with two @@s in them and lines starting with + and -:

How to read a normal diff

The patch file contains a section for each file that should be changed. That section starts with a line identifying the file. That line has the file name and path of first the old and then the new version in it:

diff violet-park-2.orig/style.css violet-park-2/style.css

Then follow sets of changes, called hunks. The first line of each hunk contains

    the line or line range from,to in the file before the changes
    a letter indicating a change (c), an addition (a) or a deletion (d)
    the line or line range in the file after the changes

all without spaces inbetween.

A change looks like this:

    73
    <   red
    ---
    >   blue

That means, change line 73, which contains red, to blue. The new line is lineafter all changes.

The new line number could also have been, say, 75. In that case all additions, deletions and changes before that line added up to the file after all changes.

Instead of single line numbers, a line range can be specified, for example:

    90,94
    ...

That means, change linesfile to the following, which will be linesfile. The same applies for additions and deletions.

An addition looks like this:

    80,81
    > line1
    > line2

That means, in the original file after line. These will be lines.

And finally, a deletion looks like this:

    77
    < line1

That means, delete linefile. The line, that preceded linefile will be linefile.

How to read a context diff

The patch file contains a section for each file that should be changed. That section starts with the file name and path of first the old and then the new version and some additional information:

    diff -c violet-park-2.orig/archive.php violet-park-2/archive.php
    *** violet-park-2.orig/archive.php      2009-10-10 07:37:43.000000000 +0200
    --- violet-park-2/archive.php   2009-10-10 09:05:58.000000000 +0200

patch is pretty lax about the format of these lines, as long as it can find out the file names. In patches generated by version control systems like cvs, svn or git these little different.

Then follow sets of changes, called hunks. Each hunk starts with a line with. Then comes a line with the line range from,to and the lines from file before the changes. Lines that start with an ! are changed, lines that start with a - are deleted. Then comes the line range and the lines in the file after all changes. Lines that start with a ! are, again, changed, and lines that start with a + are added. Each line modified by the patch is surrounded withbefore and after.

A change looks like this:

    ***************
    *** 70,76 ****
      foo
      bar
      baz
    ! red
      more context
      and more
      still context
    --- 70,76 ----
      foo
      bar
      baz
    ! blue
      more context
      and more
      still context

That means, change line 73 (= 70 + in the file before all changes, which contains red to blue. The changed line is also line 73 (= 70 + in the file after all changes.

Here’s an example for an addition:

    ***************
    *** 75,80 ****
    --- 77,84 ----
      foo
      bar
      baz
    + line1
    + linemore
      and still context

That means, in the original file after line 78 (= 75 + add . These will be lines 80 (= 77 + through.

And that’s how a deletion looks like:

    ***************
    *** 75,81 ****
      foo
      bar
      baz
    - linemore
      and still context
    --- 75,80 ----

That means, delete line 78 (= 75 + in the original file. The unchanged context will be on lines.

How to read a unified diff

The patch file contains a section for each file that should be changed. That section starts with the file name and path of first the old and then the new version and some additional information:

    diff -u violet-park-2.orig/archive.php violet-park-2/archive.php
    --- violet-park-2.orig/archive.php      2009-10-10 07:37:43.000000000 +0200
    +++ violet-park-2/archive.php   2009-10-10 09:05:58.000000000 +0200

patch is pretty lax about the format of these lines, as long as it can find out the file names. In patches generated by version control systems like cvs, svn or git these little different.

Then follow sets of changes, called hunks. Each hunk starts with a line that contains, enclosed in @@, the line or line range from,no-of-lines in the file before (with a -) and after (with a +) the changes. After that come the lines from the file. Lines starting with a - are deleted, lines starting with a + are added. Each line modified by the patch is surrounded withbefore and after.

An addition looks like this:
